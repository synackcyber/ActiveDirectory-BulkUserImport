Fill in the CSV file with the new user properties. I recommend using 1 test user first. 
Copy the .ps1 and the .csv to a non-root directory on the ADDS server
Open PowerShell ISE as Administrator and open the directory where the .ps1 and .csv file are located.
Run the script and refresh ADDS to see the new users created. Check the proxyAddress attribute.
After a successful test you can bulk add the users into the CSV and save some time!

Enjoy! :)
